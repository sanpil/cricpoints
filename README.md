This is how ARCL (https://arcl.org/) calculates points for each game.

There will be 30 points awarded per game. Losing team can get a maximum of 10 bonus points.  If team plays with less than 8 people and the other team get them all out and lose, they will get maximum points for bowling regardless of wickets they took since ALL OUT will be considered a special case. Winning team gets 20 points plus the leftover bonus points from losing team. For example if the losing teams gets 4 points, the winning team will get 20 + (10-4) = 26 points. In case of a Tie both teams will get 15 points and no bonus points. 

Batting points for the losing team is calculated as follows:

If the losing team is batting second, then:
Points	Formula based on team score
1	>50 % and <=60% of winning teams score
2	>60% and <=70% of winning teams score
3	>70% and <=80% of winning teams score
4	>80% and <=90% of winning teams score
5	>90% of winning teams score

If the losing team is batting first, then:
Points	Formula based on run rate
1	>50 % and <=60% of winning teams run rate
2	>60% and <=70% of winning teams run rate
3	>70% and <=80% of winning teams run rate
4	>80% and <=90% of winning teams run rate
5	>90% of winning teams run rate

Bowling bonus points are calculated using:
